# Thinkful Server Side Javascript Program


## Instalation

Open a terminal window and:

```bash
$ cd ~/Sites #or wherever you keep your projects

$ git clone https://github.com/Naxus28/thinkful-server-side.git

$ cd thinkful-server-side
```

This will install all subdirectores (each of which hosting a different project) or this repo

Once you have all subdirectories installed, just `cd` into the project you want to look at and:

```bash
$ npm install && npm start
```

Then open your browser to the URL displayed on the terminal to see the app.
