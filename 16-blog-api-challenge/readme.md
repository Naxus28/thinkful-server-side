# Blog API

To close out this lesson, you'll build a CRUD API for a blogging platform.

For this challenge, we'd like you to start (almost) from scratch in order to get more practice creating new Node/Express applications.

Here are the requirements for this app:

Use npm init to initialize your project

• Install uuid, which is a Node package that the blog post model will require, by running npm install uuid from within your folder for this project

• Your app should support the four CRUD operations for a blog posts resource.

• GET and POST requests should go to /blog-posts.

• DELETE and PUT requests should go to /blog-posts/:id.

• Use Express router and modularize routes to /blog-posts.

• Add a couple of blog posts on server load so you'll automatically have some data to look at when the server starts.
